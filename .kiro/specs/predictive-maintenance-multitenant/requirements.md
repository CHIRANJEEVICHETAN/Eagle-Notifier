# Predictive Maintenance Multi-Tenant Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a predictive maintenance system within the existing multi-tenant Eagle Notifier platform. The system will analyze real-time SCADA data to predict equipment failures 5-10 minutes in advance, delivering intelligent alerts to users through the existing React Native mobile application. The implementation must seamlessly integrate with the current multi-tenant architecture while supporting organization-specific SCADA schemas and ML models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tenant ML Model Management

**User Story:** As a Super Admin, I want to manage predictive maintenance models for each organization independently, so that each client can have customized failure prediction based on their specific equipment and historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Super Admin accesses the organization management interface THEN they SHALL see predictive maintenance configuration options for each organization
2. WHEN a Super Admin configures ML model settings for an organization THEN the system SHALL store organization-specific model configurations in the database
3. WHEN an organization has different SCADA schema columns THEN the system SHALL support dynamic feature mapping for that organization's ML model
4. IF an organization's ML model fails to load THEN the system SHALL fallback to rule-based alerts for that organization only
5. WHEN a new organization is onboarded THEN the system SHALL provide default ML model configuration templates

### Requirement 2: Organization-Specific SCADA Data Processing

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the predictive maintenance system to process my organization's SCADA data using our specific schema and column mappings, so that predictions are accurate for our equipment configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SCADA data is processed for an organization THEN the system SHALL use that organization's specific schema configuration from the database
2. WHEN generating features for ML prediction THEN the system SHALL map SCADA columns according to the organization's schema config
3. WHEN an organization has custom column names THEN the system SHALL dynamically adapt feature engineering to use those column names
4. IF SCADA data contains missing columns for an organization THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with forward-fill or default values
5. WHEN processing lag and rolling features THEN the system SHALL use organization-specific time windows if configured

### Requirement 3: Real-Time Predictive Alert Generation

**User Story:** As an operator, I want to receive predictive maintenance alerts on my mobile device when equipment failure is likely within the next 5-10 minutes, so that I can take preventive action before critical failures occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ML model predicts failure probability above 85% THEN the system SHALL generate a PREDICTIVE alert
2. WHEN a predictive alert is generated THEN it SHALL include confidence score, predicted component, and estimated time to failure
3. WHEN multiple predictive alerts are generated for the same component THEN the system SHALL deduplicate alerts within a 5-minute window
4. WHEN predictive alerts are sent THEN they SHALL be scoped to users within the same organization only
5. WHEN the mobile app receives a predictive alert THEN it SHALL display with distinct visual styling (blue color scheme)

### Requirement 4: Hybrid Alert System Integration

**User Story:** As an operator, I want to see both rule-based and predictive alerts in a unified interface, so that I can respond to both immediate issues and predicted failures efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the alert processing service runs THEN it SHALL generate both rule-based and ML-based alerts simultaneously
2. WHEN displaying alerts in the mobile app THEN predictive alerts SHALL be clearly distinguished from traditional alarms
3. WHEN an alert is acknowledged THEN the system SHALL track whether it was rule-based, predictive, or both
4. IF the ML prediction service is unavailable THEN rule-based alerts SHALL continue to function normally
5. WHEN generating alert history reports THEN both alert types SHALL be included with proper categorization

### Requirement 5: Per-Organization Model Training Pipeline

**User Story:** As a Data Engineer, I want to train and deploy ML models specific to each organization's historical data and equipment patterns, so that predictions are optimized for each client's unique operational characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training a model for an organization THEN the system SHALL use only that organization's historical SCADA data
2. WHEN an organization's model is retrained THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy the new model without affecting other organizations
3. WHEN model training completes THEN the system SHALL validate model performance before deployment
4. IF a newly trained model performs worse than the current model THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous version
5. WHEN model training fails THEN the system SHALL notify administrators and maintain the existing model

### Requirement 6: Organization-Scoped Model Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to monitor the accuracy and performance of our predictive maintenance system, so that I can assess its effectiveness and request improvements when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users provide feedback on predictive alerts THEN the system SHALL track accuracy metrics per organization
2. WHEN generating performance reports THEN metrics SHALL be scoped to the requesting user's organization only
3. WHEN model accuracy drops below 80% THEN the system SHALL notify organization administrators
4. WHEN viewing model performance dashboard THEN administrators SHALL see organization-specific metrics only
5. WHEN comparing model versions THEN the system SHALL show performance improvements or degradations over time

### Requirement 7: Scalable Model Deployment Architecture

**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want the predictive maintenance system to scale efficiently across multiple organizations without performance degradation, so that all clients receive reliable service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple organizations' data is processed simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms prediction latency per organization
2. WHEN an organization's model is updated THEN other organizations' predictions SHALL not be interrupted
3. WHEN system load increases THEN the prediction service SHALL queue requests and process them within 5 seconds
4. IF memory usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL implement model caching strategies to optimize resource usage
5. WHEN scaling to 50+ organizations THEN the system SHALL maintain current performance benchmarks

### Requirement 8: Mobile App Predictive Features Integration

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want predictive maintenance features to integrate seamlessly with the existing alarm management workflow, so that I can manage all alerts through a familiar interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the alarm list THEN predictive alerts SHALL appear alongside traditional alarms with clear visual distinction
2. WHEN acknowledging a predictive alert THEN the system SHALL follow the same workflow as traditional alarms
3. WHEN a predictive alert is resolved THEN users SHALL be able to provide feedback on prediction accuracy
4. WHEN generating reports THEN predictive alerts SHALL be included in alarm history and analytics
5. WHEN using offline mode THEN previously loaded predictive alerts SHALL remain accessible

### Requirement 9: Automated Model Retraining System

**User Story:** As a Super Admin, I want ML models to be automatically retrained weekly using the latest data, so that prediction accuracy improves over time without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the weekly retraining schedule runs THEN each organization's model SHALL be retrained using their latest 365 days of data
2. WHEN retraining completes successfully THEN the new model SHALL be automatically deployed after validation
3. WHEN retraining fails for an organization THEN the system SHALL retry twice before alerting administrators
4. WHEN model deployment occurs THEN there SHALL be zero downtime for prediction services
5. WHEN retraining is in progress THEN the current model SHALL continue serving predictions

### Requirement 10: Security and Data Isolation

**User Story:** As a Security Administrator, I want to ensure that each organization's ML models and training data are completely isolated from other organizations, so that sensitive operational data remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training models THEN each organization's data SHALL be processed in isolation with no cross-contamination
2. WHEN storing model artifacts THEN they SHALL be encrypted and scoped to the owning organization
3. WHEN accessing prediction services THEN users SHALL only receive predictions based on their organization's model
4. IF a security breach is detected THEN affected organization's models SHALL be immediately isolated
5. WHEN auditing system access THEN all ML-related operations SHALL be logged with organization context
