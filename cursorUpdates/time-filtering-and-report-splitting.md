# Time Filtering and Report Splitting Implementation

## Overview
This update adds precise time filtering and automatic report splitting for large time ranges, specifically designed for SCADA data that generates 86,400 records per day.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Precise Time Filtering** ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `app/components/ReportGenerator.tsx`

**New Functionality:**
- **Date AND Time Selection**: Users can now select specific hours and minutes, not just dates
- **Default Range**: Changed from 7 days to 6 hours (optimal for SCADA data)
- **Separate Pickers**: Dedicated date and time pickers for start and end times

**UI Changes:**
```
Before: Only date selection
Start Date: May 25, 2025

After: Date + Time selection  
Start Date: May 25, 2025    Time: 08:00
End Date: May 25, 2025      Time: 14:00
```

### 2. **Intelligent Report Splitting** ✅

**How It Works:**
1. **Detection**: Automatically detects when selected range > 6 hours
2. **User Confirmation**: Shows dialog explaining the split process
3. **Chunk Generation**: Splits into 6-hour chunks automatically
4. **Sequential Processing**: Generates reports one by one to prevent memory issues
5. **Smart Naming**: Each report includes part number and time range

**Example Split Process:**
```
Selected: May 25, 08:00 - May 26, 02:00 (18 hours)

Generated Reports:
1. Furnace_Report_Part_1_of_3_08-00_to_14-00.xlsx  (6 hours)
2. Furnace_Report_Part_2_of_3_14-00_to_20-00.xlsx  (6 hours)  
3. Furnace_Report_Part_3_of_3_20-00_to_02-00.xlsx  (6 hours)
```

### 3. **Frontend Recommendations Display** ✅

**Visual Guide Added:**
```
📊 Recommended Time Ranges
✅ 1-2 hours: Fast & Reliable
✅ 3-6 hours: Good Performance
⚠️ 6-12 hours: Slow (may split)
❌ 12+ hours: Will auto-split
```

## Summary

**New Capabilities:**
✅ **Precise Time Selection**: Hour and minute precision  
✅ **Automatic Splitting**: Large ranges handled automatically  
✅ **Visual Guidance**: Clear recommendations and warnings  
✅ **Smart Naming**: Easy identification of related reports  
✅ **Memory Safe**: 6-hour chunks prevent OOM errors  

**Optimal User Workflow:**
1. Select precise start date and time
2. Select precise end date and time  
3. View automatic recommendations
4. Generate report (auto-split if needed)
5. Access all generated reports in reports list
