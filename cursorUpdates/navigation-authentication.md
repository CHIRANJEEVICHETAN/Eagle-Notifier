# Navigation and Authentication Flow Improvements

## Latest Updates

- Simplified navigation flow to always show onboarding for unauthenticated users
- Fixed API connection issues by updating server address and improving error handling
- Added loading state to the onboarding screen's "Get Started" button
- Improved error messages for common authentication failures
- Removed dependency on hasSeenOnboarding flag for initial routing

## Implementation Details

- Centralized all navigation logic in the AuthContext for better organization and to avoid redundancies
- Improved onboarding to login flow by properly handling navigation after asking for notifications permission
- Consolidated all routing logic to prevent navigation loops and redundant code
- Added navigation state tracking to prevent rapid navigation attempts that could cause issues
- Fixed type issues with Expo Router navigation paths
- Enhanced API connection error handling with detailed error messages

## Affected Components and Files

- `app/context/AuthContext.tsx`:
  - Added centralized navigation management with `checkAuthRoute` function
  - Added `navigateTo` helper to handle safe navigation with type casting
  - Removed direct router calls from login/logout functions
  - Simplified routing logic to focus on authentication state
  - Added detailed API error handling

- `app/_layout.tsx`:
  - Removed redundant AuthGuard component
  - Added lightweight AuthRouteChecker to invoke route checking

- `app/onboarding.tsx`:
  - Fixed "Get Started" button navigation
  - Added loading state to indicate action in progress
  - Improved error handling with proper state management

- `app/(auth)/login.tsx`:
  - Removed redundant navigation logic
  - Simplified login flow by relying on AuthContext for routing

- `app/api/config.ts`:
  - Updated API URL to correctly point to the local server

## Updated Navigation Flow

1. All unauthenticated users are first directed to the onboarding screen
2. After clicking "Get Started" on onboarding, notification permissions are requested
3. User is directed to login screen after onboarding is complete
4. After login, users are automatically directed to the appropriate dashboard based on their role:
   - Admin users go to /(dashboard)/admin/
   - Operator users go to the home page

## Debugging Features

- Added detailed error logging for API connection issues
- Improved error messages for common authentication failures
- Added loading indicators to improve user experience during network operations

## Security Considerations

- Protected routes ensure users can only access the parts of the app appropriate for their role
- Onboarding state is securely stored in SecureStore
- Navigation checks prevent unauthorized access to protected areas

## Future Improvements

- Add path-specific route guards for more granular access control
- Implement route-level permissions based on user roles
- Add transition animations between different app sections
