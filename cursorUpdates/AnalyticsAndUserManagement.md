# Eagle Notifier - Analytics and User Management Implementation

This document provides details on the implementation of the Analytics, User Management, and Setpoint Management features for the Eagle Notifier application.

## Implementation Details

### Analytics Screen
- **Time Range Filtering**: Ability to select predefined time ranges (1H, 12H, 24H, 1D, 3D, 7D) and custom date ranges for analysis
- **Analog Alarms Chart**: Line chart visualizing temperature, carbon, and other analog alarm values over time
- **Binary Alarms Chart**: Bar chart displaying binary state changes (running/stopped) of conveyors, motors, fans, etc.
- **Custom Legends**: Color-coded legends for each alarm type with clear identification
- **Report Generation**: Button to generate downloadable reports of displayed data
- **Responsive Design**: Charts adapt to different screen sizes
- **Theme Support**: Dark and light mode compatibility for all UI elements

### User Management
- **User List**: Display of all system users with their roles and information
- **Create User**: Form to add new users with name, email, password, and role selection
- **Edit User**: Ability to update existing user details and change roles
- **Delete User**: Confirmation-gated ability to remove users from the system
- **Role Management**: Toggle between admin and operator roles with clear visual distinction
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for all required fields
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately while server changes are being processed

### Setpoint Management
- **Setpoint List**: Display of all configurable alarm thresholds
- **Edit Setpoints**: Inline editing of:
  - Target value (e.g., temperature setpoint)
  - Low deviation (acceptable lower bound)
  - High deviation (acceptable upper bound)
- **Type Categorization**: Clear visual distinction between different types of setpoints
- **Unit Display**: Proper display of measurement units (Â°C, %, etc.)
- **Last Update Info**: Tracking of when and by whom setpoints were last modified
- **Validation**: Numeric validation for all setpoint and deviation values

## Affected Components/Hooks
- `app/(dashboard)/analytics/index.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/users/index.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/setpoints/index.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/index.tsx` (updated navigation)
- `app/hooks/useAlarms.ts` (extended with useAlarmHistory)

## Styling/Navigation Changes
- Consistent styling across all new screens with dark/light theme support
- Navigation paths updated in admin dashboard to link to new screens
- Expo Router file-based routing with proper file organization
- Responsive layouts with proper ScrollView and FlatList implementations
- Modern UI elements like cards, badges, and modal dialogs

## Performance Optimizations
- **Memoized Calculations**: `useMemo` and `useCallback` for computationally expensive operations
- **Optimized Chart Rendering**: Limiting number of visible data points for smoother performance
- **Efficient Date Handling**: Proper formatting and calculations with date-fns
- **Query Caching**: TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Background Processing**: Mutations run in background with loading indicators
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately while server processes the changes
- **Pagination Support**: Ready for implementation of paginated data fetching

## Next Steps
1. Connect the front-end components to the actual backend API
2. Implement WebSocket support for real-time data updates in charts
3. Add export functionality for PDF/Excel reports
4. Enhance chart interactivity with zooming and tooltip features
5. Add user profiles and avatar management
6. Implement more advanced permission management
7. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
