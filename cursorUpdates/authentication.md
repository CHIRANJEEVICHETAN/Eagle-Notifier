# Authentication System Improvements

## Implementation Details

- Implemented complete token-based authentication with both access and refresh tokens
- Added proper token refresh mechanism using axios interceptors
- Set up push token registration during login and deregistration during logout
- Fixed router type issues with path declarations
- Improved error handling for authentication failures

## Affected Components and Files

- `app/context/AuthContext.tsx`:
  - Added token refresh mechanism
  - Improved push token handling during login/logout
  - Fixed type issues with router navigation
  - Added proper auth state management

- `app/types/auth.ts`:
  - Added pushToken field to User interface
  
- `backend/src/routes/authRoutes.ts`:
  - Added new refresh token endpoint
  - Updated login endpoint to provide refresh tokens
  - Improved error handling for token verification

## Authentication Flow

1. **Login**:
   - User logs in with credentials
   - Backend validates credentials and returns access token, refresh token, and user data
   - Frontend stores tokens in SecureStore
   - Push notification token is registered with backend

2. **Token Refresh**:
   - When a 401 error occurs, the axios interceptor attempts to refresh the token
   - If refresh is successful, the original request is retried
   - If refresh fails, user is logged out and redirected to login

3. **Logout**:
   - Push notification token is deregistered
   - Tokens are removed from SecureStore
   - User is redirected to login screen

## Security Considerations

- Tokens are stored in SecureStore for enhanced security
- Axios interceptors handle token expiration gracefully
- Role-based routing ensures users can only access appropriate sections
- Backend validates tokens on each request

## Future Improvements

- Implement token blacklisting on the backend
- Add token rotation for refresh tokens
- Implement multi-device management for tokens
- Add the ability to log out from all devices
