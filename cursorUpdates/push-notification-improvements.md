# Push Notification Registration Improvements

## Latest Updates

- Added protection against redundant token registration attempts
- Implemented conflict detection for push tokens already in use
- Added throttling to prevent frequent retry attempts
- Enhanced backend to properly handle token conflicts with 409 status

## Implementation Details

- Added robust error handling for push token registration and deregistration
- Implemented retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for network errors
- Created fallback system to handle failed registrations on subsequent app starts
- Added timeouts to prevent long-hanging operations
- Improved logging for better debugging of notification-related issues
- Added prevention for duplicate registration requests

## Affected Components and Files

- `app/context/AuthContext.tsx`:
  - Enhanced push token registration in login function with retry logic
  - Added checks to prevent redundant registrations
  - Added throttling for retry attempts (maximum once per 5 minutes)
  - Improved token status tracking with SecureStore flags
  - Added conflict detection and handling
  - Added `retryPushTokenRegistration` function for persistent retries
  - Improved push token deregistration in logout function

- `backend/src/routes/notifications.ts`:
  - Enhanced token registration endpoint to check for conflicts
  - Added proper 409 status codes for duplicate tokens
  - Improved response data with user details for verification
  - Added better error handling

## Technical Implementation

### Push Token Registration

1. **Duplicate Prevention**:
   - Check if token is already registered for current user
   - Skip registration if token already matches
   - Backend checks if token is already registered to another user
   - Returns 409 conflict status for duplicate tokens

2. **Throttling**:
   - Track last registration attempt time
   - Limit retry frequency to once per 5 minutes
   - Use exponential backoff for network error retries

3. **Status Tracking**:
   - Store registration status in SecureStore
   - Track both success and failure states
   - Use status flags to determine if retry is needed

## User Experience Improvements

- No redundant registration attempts causing unnecessary errors
- No duplicate push tokens across different users
- Reduced network traffic from unnecessary requests
- Better error logs to distinguish between actual failures and conflicts

## Future Improvements

- Implement web socket notification fallback when push notifications are unavailable
- Add UI for managing push notification permissions and preferences
- Create a dedicated notification settings interface for users
- Implement a push notification test feature for users
