# Furnace Report Generation Fixes

## Date: 2025-01-15

## Overview
Fixed multiple issues with the furnace report generation system, including carbon threshold values, database storage, UI improvements, and column filtering.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Carbon Threshold Columns Empty
- **Problem**: Carbon High/Low Threshold columns were empty in generated reports
- **Solution**: Fixed the carbon threshold calculation in `reportRoutes.ts` by directly setting `cph` and `cpl` fields
- **Implementation**:
  - Modified the threshold calculation logic to handle carbon potential fields separately
  - Correctly maps `cpsv` (Carbon Potential Set Value) to calculate thresholds

### 2. Reports Not Saved to Database
- **Problem**: Generated reports were not being stored in the FurnaceReport table
- **Solution**: Added proper database saving functionality in `useFurnaceReports.ts`
- **Implementation**:
  - File content is converted to base64 before saving
  - Report metadata is properly stored including title, format, file size, date range, and filters
  - Added `refetchReports()` call after successful save to update the reports list

### 3. Improved Report Access Modal
- **Problem**: Direct sharing after generation without user choice
- **Solution**: Added a success modal with Open/Share options
- **Implementation**:
  - Created modal with two action buttons: Open Report and Share Report
  - Added `handleOpenFile` function using expo-intent-launcher for Android
  - Added `handleShareFile` function for cross-platform sharing
  - Stores generated file path for immediate access without database round-trip

### 4. Removed Unnecessary Columns
- **Problem**: Report contained redundant columns that weren't needed
- **Solution**: Removed 12 unnecessary columns from the Excel report
- **Removed Columns**:
  - Hardening Conveyor Fail/Trip
  - Oil Conveyor Fail/Trip
  - HZ1/HZ2 Fan Fail/Trip
  - Temperature Conveyor Fail/Trip
  - TZ1/TZ2 Fan Trip

## Affected Components

### Backend
- **`backend/src/routes/reportRoutes.ts`**:
  - Fixed carbon threshold calculation logic
  - Properly sets `cph` and `cpl` fields based on setpoint deviations

### Frontend Hooks
- **`app/hooks/useFurnaceReports.ts`**:
  - Added expo-intent-launcher import for file opening
  - Updated `openReport` to use IntentLauncher on Android
  - Added proper report refresh after generation
  - Improved error handling for save operations

### Frontend Components
- **`app/(dashboard)/reports/index.tsx`**:
  - Added success modal with Open/Share options
  - Added file path state management
  - Created `handleOpenFile` and `handleShareFile` functions
  - Updated modal buttons to use new functions
  - Added proper state cleanup on modal close

- **`app/components/ReportGenerator.tsx`**:
  - Removed automatic file sharing after generation
  - Returns file path to parent component for handling

- **`app/services/ExcelReportService.ts`**:
  - Removed 12 unnecessary columns from the chronological data processing
  - Cleaned up the report output for better clarity

## New Features
1. **Direct File Access**: Reports can be opened immediately after generation without database fetch
2. **Platform-specific Opening**: Uses expo-intent-launcher on Android for native file opening
3. **User Choice Modal**: Users can choose to open or share the report after generation
4. **Proper State Management**: File paths and report IDs are managed and cleaned up properly

## Performance Improvements
- Reduced database round-trips by using local file path for immediate access
- Faster report opening experience for users
- Better error handling and fallback mechanisms

## UI/UX Enhancements
- Clear success modal with intuitive options
- Icons for Open and Share actions
- Proper modal dismissal and state cleanup
- Better user feedback throughout the process
