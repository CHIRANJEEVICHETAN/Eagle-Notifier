# User Avatar and Profile Update Features

## Implementation Details

### Avatar Upload and Profile Management
- Added ability to upload profile picture using device camera or image library
- Implemented avatar image storage as Base64 in the database (using Text field type)
- Enhanced profile editing with proper validation for email and name fields
- Improved password change functionality with comprehensive security checks

### Backend Integration
- Updated Prisma schema to use Text type for avatar storage
- Added robust API endpoints for profile management:
  - PUT `/api/auth/profile` - Update user profile (name, email, avatar)
  - PUT `/api/auth/change-password` - Change user password
  - DELETE `/api/auth/avatar` - Remove user avatar

### Components/Hooks Changes
- Enhanced ProfileScreen in app/(dashboard)/profile/index.tsx with:
  - Image upload capabilities (camera and gallery)
  - Form validation for all user inputs
  - Improved error handling and user feedback
  - Visual indicators during loading states

### Styling/Navigation
- Added styled error messages for form validation
- Implemented loading indicators for all API operations
- Enhanced the avatar display with camera icon for upload prompt
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### Performance Optimizations
- Optimized image processing with quality reduction to 0.7
- Used image cropping to standardize avatar sizes
- Validated image size before upload to prevent oversized Base64 strings

## Prisma Migration Commands

To apply these changes to your database, run the following Prisma migration commands:

```bash
# Generate migration file
npx prisma migrate dev --name update_avatar_to_text

# Apply migration to development database
npx prisma migrate dev

# Apply migration to production database (when ready)
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## SQL Migration (Manual Alternative)

If you prefer to manually apply the schema change, here's the SQL command:

```sql
-- PostgreSQL
ALTER TABLE "User" ALTER COLUMN "avatar" TYPE TEXT;

-- For MySQL/MariaDB
ALTER TABLE User MODIFY avatar TEXT;
```
