# Alarm History Enhancement

## Implementation Details

### Backend Improvements
- Enhanced database connection pooling to prevent "Too many database connections" errors
  - Implemented a singleton pattern for the connection pool with auto-reconnect capabilities
  - Added retry mechanisms for database operations
  - Optimized connection settings (max connections, timeouts, etc.)
- Implemented SCADA polling interval respecting mechanism
  - Added caching for SCADA data to avoid unnecessary database queries
  - Used environment variable with default value (2 minutes) for polling interval
  - Added ability to force refresh data when needed
- Enhanced filtering on the backend
  - Added support for filtering by alarm type and alarm ID
  - Fixed query parameters handling for more reliable filtering

### Frontend Improvements
- Replaced SectionList with FlashList for better performance
- Fixed pagination issue by using state management for current page
- Implemented proper view modes:
  - Main view: Shows separate Analog and Binary alarm lists
  - Detail view: Shows history of a specific alarm with values, status, and timestamps
- Enhanced filtering capabilities:
  - Filter by status (active/acknowledged/resolved)
  - Filter by time range (24h/3d/7d/30d/all)
  - Filter by alarm type (temperature, carbon, level, fan, heater)
  - Search functionality
- Created a dedicated hook for fetching specific alarm history

### Performance Optimizations
- Improved database connection management to prevent connection timeouts
- Optimized list rendering with FlashList
- Implemented proper data caching with TanStack Query
- Added data pagination for efficient loading of large datasets
- Optimized UI rendering with React.memo and useMemo hooks

### Styling and Navigation Changes
- Implemented responsive design for main view (side-by-side lists)
- Added consistent styling for error and empty states
- Improved navigation between main view, detail view, and alarm details modal
- Enhanced status indicators and badges for better visibility

## Affected Components/Hooks
- `backend/src/config/scadaDb.ts`: Enhanced database connection pooling
- `backend/src/services/scadaService.ts`: Added poll interval respecting mechanism
- `backend/src/routes/scadaRoutes.ts`: Updated endpoints to support new parameters
- `app/hooks/useAlarms.ts`: Enhanced hooks with better filtering support
- `app/(dashboard)/alarms/history.tsx`: Complete UI rewrite with improved layout and FlashList

## Error Resolution
- Fixed connection timeout errors by implementing better connection pooling
- Fixed pagination issue by properly tracking current page in state
- Implemented proper error handling and retries for API calls

## Future Improvements
- Add data visualization for alarm history trends
- Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
- Enhance filtering with saved filter presets
- Add export capabilities for alarm history reports
