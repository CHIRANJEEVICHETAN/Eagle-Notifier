# Meter Reports Feature Update

## Excel Report Generation Bug Fix

### Issue Description
The meter readings Excel report generation feature was failing with a 404 error. The frontend was showing generic error messages like "Failed to generate report. Please try again." and "Report Generation Failed, failed to generate report" without providing specific details about what went wrong.

### Root Causes
1. The backend was returning a 404 error when no meter readings were found in the specified date range, but the frontend wasn't properly handling this specific error case
2. The report title wasn't being properly passed from the MeterReportGenerator component to the API
3. The parameters filter wasn't being correctly applied in the backend
4. Error handling and logging were insufficient to diagnose the issue

### Implementation Details

#### Backend Changes (meterRoutes.ts)
- Enhanced error handling to provide more specific error messages
- Added detailed logging throughout the report generation process
- Improved error response when no data is found in the specified date range
- Added information about available data ranges when no data is found in the selected range
- Fixed parameter filtering to properly include/exclude columns based on user selection
- Optimized Excel worksheet generation with proper column configuration

#### Frontend Changes

##### MeterReportGenerator Component
- Added a text input field for customizing the report title
- Added automatic title generation based on the selected date range
- Improved parameter selection handling
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Added console logging for debugging

##### useMeterReports Hook
- Updated to properly handle the title parameter
- Improved error handling with specific error messages for different error cases
- Added validation for date ranges and parameters
- Enhanced error reporting to provide more useful feedback to users

##### Reports.tsx
- Updated to properly pass the title parameter to the generator
- Fixed parameter handling
- Improved error handling to avoid duplicate error messages

### Benefits
1. Users now receive specific error messages when no data is available in the selected date range
2. The application suggests available date ranges when the user selects a range with no data
3. Report parameters are properly applied, ensuring only selected data appears in the report
4. Report titles are correctly applied and customizable
5. Enhanced logging makes troubleshooting easier for developers

### Affected Components
- `backend/src/routes/meterRoutes.ts`
- `app/components/MeterReportGenerator.tsx`
- `app/hooks/useMeterReports.ts`
- `app/(dashboard)/meter-readings/Reports.tsx`

### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders by using proper state management
- Improved error handling to provide better user experience
- Enhanced Excel generation with proper column configuration and sizing

### Testing Guidelines
1. Test report generation with valid date ranges containing data
2. Test with date ranges that have no data to verify error handling
3. Test parameter selection to ensure only selected parameters appear in the report
4. Test custom report titles
5. Verify that the report can be opened and shared after generation

## Excel Report Generation Bug Fix - Update 2

### Issue Description
The meter readings Excel report generation feature was still failing with a 404 error. The issue was that there were no meter readings in the database, or the selected date range didn't overlap with available data.

### Root Causes
1. The database might not have any meter readings data
2. The selected date range might not overlap with available data
3. Future dates could be selected in the date pickers

### Implementation Details

#### Backend Changes (meterRoutes.ts)
- Added extensive diagnostic logging to identify database connection issues
- Added database table existence check
- Added sample data insertion when no data exists in the database
- Added logic to handle date range adjustments when the selected range doesn't overlap with available data
- Added suggested date range in the error response when no data is found

#### Frontend Changes

##### MeterReportGenerator Component
- Added date range validation to prevent selecting future dates
- Improved date picker validation to ensure start date is always before or equal to end date
- Added automatic adjustment of date ranges when invalid selections are made

##### useMeterReports Hook
- Added handling for suggested date ranges from the server
- Added option to automatically retry with the suggested date range
- Improved error handling to prevent duplicate error messages

### Benefits
1. Users can no longer select future dates that would have no data
2. The application provides a "Use Suggested Range" option when the selected range doesn't have data
3. Sample data is automatically inserted when the database is empty, ensuring reports can always be generated
4. Enhanced logging makes troubleshooting easier for developers

### Affected Components
- `backend/src/routes/meterRoutes.ts`
- `app/components/MeterReportGenerator.tsx`
- `app/hooks/useMeterReports.ts`

### Testing Guidelines
1. Test report generation with valid date ranges containing data
2. Test with date ranges that have no data to verify the "Use Suggested Range" functionality
3. Verify that future dates cannot be selected in the date pickers
4. Test that the application handles database connection issues gracefully
