# Organization-Level Isolation Fix

## Overview
Fixed critical organization-level isolation issues that were causing cross-organization data leakage and notifications. Users from one organization were receiving notifications and accessing data from other organizations.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Notification Service - Cross-Organization Notifications**
**Problem**: The `NotificationService.createNotification` method was fetching ALL users with push tokens regardless of their organization, causing users from "Nagpur" to receive notifications meant for "Ennar".

**Root Cause**: 
```typescript
// BEFORE: Fetching all users regardless of organization
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    pushToken: { not: null } // Only get users with push tokens
  },
  include: {
    notificationSettings: true
  }
});
```

**Fix**: Added organization filtering at the database query level
```typescript
// AFTER: Filter users by organization first
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    pushToken: { not: null }, // Only get users with push tokens
    organizationId: data.organizationId // CRITICAL: Filter by organization
  },
  include: {
    notificationSettings: true
  }
});
```

### 2. **SCADA Service - Cross-Organization Setpoints**
**Problem**: The `getSetpointConfigs` function was fetching ALL setpoints instead of filtering by organization, potentially causing alarms to be calculated using setpoints from other organizations.

**Root Cause**:
```sql
-- BEFORE: Fetching all setpoints
SELECT id, name, type, zone, "scadaField", "lowDeviation", "highDeviation"
FROM "Setpoint"
```

**Fix**: Added organization filtering
```sql
-- AFTER: Filter by organization
SELECT id, name, type, zone, "scadaField", "lowDeviation", "highDeviation"
FROM "Setpoint"
WHERE "organizationId" = $1
```

### 3. **Meter Routes - Cross-Organization Limits**
**Problem**: The `checkThresholdViolations` function was fetching ALL meter limits instead of filtering by organization, causing threshold violations to be checked against limits from other organizations.

**Root Cause**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Fetching all meter limits
const limits = await prisma.meterLimit.findMany();
```

**Fix**: Added organization filtering and validation
```typescript
// AFTER: Filter by organization and validate
if (!organizationId) {
  console.error('❌ Organization ID is required for checking threshold violations');
  return;
}

const limits = await prisma.meterLimit.findMany({
  where: {
    organizationId: organizationId
  }
});
```

## Affected Components

### Backend Services
- **NotificationService.ts**: Fixed user filtering by organization
- **scadaService.ts**: Fixed setpoint filtering by organization  
- **meterRoutes.ts**: Fixed meter limit filtering by organization

### Database Models
- **User**: Already had `organizationId` field ✓
- **Setpoint**: Already had `organizationId` field ✓
- **MeterLimit**: Already had `organizationId` field ✓
- **Notification**: Already had `organizationId` field ✓

## Security Improvements

### 1. **Data Isolation**
- Users can only access data from their own organization
- Setpoints are organization-specific
- Meter limits are organization-specific
- Notifications are organization-specific

### 2. **Notification Isolation**
- Users only receive notifications from their own organization
- Push notifications include organizationId in metadata
- Notification settings are organization-specific

### 3. **Validation**
- Added organizationId validation in notification service
- Added organizationId validation in meter threshold checking
- Enhanced logging with organization context

## Testing Scenarios

### Before Fix
1. User from "Nagpur" organization logs in
2. Carbon Potential in "Ennar" organization goes below threshold
3. **Result**: User from "Nagpur" receives notification ❌

### After Fix
1. User from "Nagpur" organization logs in
2. Carbon Potential in "Ennar" organization goes below threshold
3. **Result**: Only users from "Ennar" receive notification ✅

## Implementation Details

### Notification Service Changes
- Added `organizationId` validation
- Modified user query to filter by organization
- Enhanced logging with organization context
- Added organizationId to push notification metadata

### SCADA Service Changes
- Modified `getSetpointConfigs` to filter by organization
- Enhanced error logging with organization context
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing alarm logic

### Meter Routes Changes
- Added organizationId validation in `checkThresholdViolations`
- Modified meter limit query to filter by organization
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Performance Impact
- **Positive**: Reduced query result sets by filtering at database level
- **Positive**: Faster notification processing due to smaller user sets
- **Neutral**: Minimal impact on existing functionality

## Monitoring and Logging
- Enhanced logging with organization context
- Added validation error logging
- Improved debugging information for cross-organization issues

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing organization-level caching
- Add organization validation middleware for all routes
- Implement organization-level rate limiting
- Add organization isolation testing in CI/CD pipeline
