- **Time Range Selection**: Choose from predefined time ranges or custom periods
- **Report Content Preview**: Preview of what will be included in the report
- **Download Handling**: Share reports or save to device storage
- **Progress Indication**: Loading states during report generation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error management with user feedback
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on both iOS and Android platforms

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach
- **Component Reusability**: Created reusable components like `ReportGenerator` for better code organization
- **State Management**: Utilized React's useState and useCallback for efficient state handling
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented memoization with useMemo for computationally expensive operations
- **Responsive Layouts**: Ensured proper layouts for various screen sizes with flexible components
- **Theme Integration**: Full dark/light theme support across all new screens
- **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling for API calls and user interactions
- **Accessibility**: Support for various screen readers and accessibility tools

### Code Organization
- **File Structure**: Followed the existing file-based routing pattern with Expo Router
- **Component Patterns**: Used consistent patterns for all new components
- **Style Architecture**: Utilized inline styling with theme awareness
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript typing for all components and functions

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Consistent Design Language**: Maintained the same design system across all screens
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual indicators for all user actions
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Simple and clear navigation patterns
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for asynchronous operations
- **Empty States**: User-friendly empty states with guidance
- **Error States**: Helpful error messages with recovery options

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Backend**: Connect the UI components to actual backend APIs
2. **Push Notification UI**: Implement the remaining notification permission UI
3. **Offline Support**: Add offline capabilities and local caching
4. **Performance Testing**: Test performance on low-end devices
5. **Unit & Integration Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage
6. **User Testing**: Conduct usability testing with real users

## Dependencies Added

- **expo-sharing**: For sharing generated reports
- **expo-file-system**: For file system operations with reports
- **date-fns**: For advanced date manipulation and formatting
