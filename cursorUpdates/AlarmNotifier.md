# Eagle Notifier - Alarm Implementation

This document provides details on the implementation of the Eagle Notifier application's alarm system, designed to monitor industrial equipment and notify users of critical conditions.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components
- **AlarmCard**: Displays individual alarms with severity-based styling, action buttons for acknowledging/resolving, and detailed information about the alarm condition.
- **AlarmCountSummary**: Shows counts of active alarms grouped by severity with visual indicators for quick assessment of system status.
- **AlarmDetails**: Modal component for viewing detailed information about a specific alarm with action buttons.
- **Dashboard**: Main screen displaying active alarms, responsive to different device sizes with pull-to-refresh functionality.

### State Management
- **Zustand Store**: Implemented for efficient alarm state management with actions for updating alarm status.
- **React Query**: Used for data fetching with caching, optimistic updates, and automatic refetching.
- **Context API**: Authentication and theming implemented with React Context for app-wide state.

### API Layer
- **Service Layer**: Implemented alarm service with methods for fetching and updating alarms.
- **REST Endpoints**: Designed RESTful API for alarms with proper routes and controllers.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secured API endpoints with token-based authentication.
- **Environment Variables**: Properly configured environment variables for secure connection details.

### Backend Implementation
- **Express Server**: Modular Express server with route management.
- **Prisma Schema**: Complete database schema for users, alarms, and alarm history with appropriate relations.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware for consistent API responses.
- **Middleware**: Authentication and authorization middleware for route protection.
- **Security Headers**: Implemented Helmet for proper security headers.
- **Rate Limiting**: Added rate limiting to protect authentication endpoints.

### Authentication & Security
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication for secure API access with proper error handling.
- **Role-Based Access**: User roles (operator, admin) with specific permissions.
- **Secure Storage**: User credentials and tokens stored using Expo SecureStore.
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage with bcryptjs.
- **CORS Protection**: Properly configured CORS to restrict access to trusted origins.
- **Environment Security**: Enforced use of environment variables for secrets with validation.

### UI/UX Features
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode with system preference detection.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes using NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native).
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual differentiation of alarm severity (critical, warning, info).
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh of alarm data at configurable intervals.
- **Modal Dialogs**: Detailed alarm information displayed in modal dialogs.

## Styling/Navigation Changes
- Used NativeWind for consistent styling across the application.
- Implemented responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Created severity-based color schemes for clear visual differentiation.
- Added proper icons from Ionicons for different alarm types and actions.
- Implemented file-based routing with Expo Router for navigation.

## Performance Optimizations
- Memoized calculation of derived values with `useMemo` and callbacks with `useCallback`.
- Implemented optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback when changing alarm status.
- Configured React Query with appropriate caching strategies:
  - More frequent refetching for active alarms (30s)
  - Less frequent for historical data (60s)
  - Stale time thresholds to prevent unnecessary refetches
- Used FlatList with performance optimizations for rendering large alarm lists.
- Implemented efficient state management with Zustand.

## Backend Architecture
- **Modular Structure**: Well-organized code with separation of concerns.
- **RESTful API**: Implemented RESTful API design principles.
- **Middleware**: Authentication, error handling, and request processing middleware.
- **Environment Configuration**: Centralized environment variable management with validation.
- **Database Access**: Prisma Client for type-safe database access.
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization and proper error handling.
- **Data Consistency**: Fixed enum consistency to ensure proper alarm severity filtering and display.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the backend to a production environment.
2. Implement push notifications for real-time alarm alerts.
3. Add analytics and reporting features for alarm trends.
4. Implement a settings screen for user preferences.
5. Add form validation for user inputs.
6. Create comprehensive test suite for components and API endpoints.
7. Implement real-time updates using WebSockets for instant alarm notifications.
