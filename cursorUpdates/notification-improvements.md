# Notification System Improvements

## Summary of Changes

We've made several improvements to the notification system to address network errors and improve reliability:

1. Fixed API URL references in notification API calls
2. Added retry mechanism for push token updates
3. Improved error handling throughout the notification flow
4. Added fallback to local storage for notification settings
5. Enhanced API error messages and logging

## Implementation Details

### API Fixes

- Updated all API endpoints in `notificationsApi.ts` to use the correct `apiConfig.apiUrl` instead of the non-existent `API_URL` constant
- Added proper URL path prefixes (`/api`) to ensure correct endpoint routing
- Implemented request timeouts to prevent hanging requests
- Made API error handling more graceful to prevent app crashes

### Push Token Registration

- Added retry mechanism for push token updates with exponential backoff
- Limit retries to prevent infinite retry loops
- Improved validation of push tokens on the server side
- Added more detailed logging for token update failures
- Store tokens in SecureStore as a backup

### Notification Settings

- Implemented local storage fallback for notification settings
- Added UI indicators for loading states during API operations
- Improved error feedback for users when settings can't be saved to server
- Added better visual feedback for test notification sends

### Backend Improvements

- Enhanced server-side validation for push tokens
- Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Improved error response messages
- Added token format validation using Expo SDK utilities

## Affected Files

- `app/api/notificationsApi.ts`: Fixed API URLs and improved error handling
- `app/NotificationProvider.tsx`: Added retry mechanism for token updates
- `app/(dashboard)/notifications/settings.tsx`: Added loading states and error handling
- `backend/src/routes/notifications.ts`: Improved token validation and error handling
- `cursorUpdates/environment-setup.md`: Documentation for environment configuration

## Testing Instructions

1. Ensure your `.env` file contains the correct environment variables (see `environment-setup.md`)
2. Start the backend server
3. Launch the app and grant notification permissions
4. Check the console logs for token registration messages
5. Test the notification settings screen with and without network connection
6. Send test notifications to verify the full flow

## Known Limitations

- Push notifications may not work in the Expo Go app without proper configuration
- Local notifications work regardless of server connectivity
- Some Android devices may require additional setup for push notifications
- iOS requires proper certificates for push notifications in production
