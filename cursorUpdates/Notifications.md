# Eagle Notifier - Notifications Feature Implementation

## Overview

The Notifications feature provides real-time alert management for users, with both frontend and backend components seamlessly integrated. This document outlines the implementation details, architectural decisions, and key components.

## Frontend Implementation

### Key Components

1. **Notification Screen (`app/(dashboard)/notifications/index.tsx`)**
   - Utilizes FlashList for efficient, virtualized rendering with minimal memory footprint
   - Implements grouping of notifications by time periods (Today, Yesterday, This Week, Earlier)
   - Supports infinite scroll with pagination for performance optimization
   - Provides filtering between all/unread notifications
   - Features batch actions for marking all notifications as read

2. **Notification Settings Screen (`app/(dashboard)/notifications/settings.tsx`)**
   - Configurable notification preferences (push, email, critical-only filters)
   - Customizable quiet hours with interactive time picker
   - Test notification sending capability for verification
   - Integration with Expo Notifications for push token management

3. **Time Range Picker (`app/components/TimeRangePicker.tsx`)**
   - Reusable component for selecting time ranges in 24-hour format
   - Interactive scrollable time selection with AM/PM display
   - Theme-aware UI elements supporting both light and dark modes
   - Optimized performance with callback memoization

4. **Notification Badge (`app/components/NotificationBadge.tsx`)**
   - Dynamic badge showing unread notification count
   - Configurable sizes (small, medium, large)
   - Optimized rendering with conditional visibility
   - Auto-refreshing count with TanStack Query's refetchInterval

### Custom Hooks

1. **`useNotifications`**
   - Implements infinite query pattern for efficient list loading
   - Supports filtering between all and unread notifications
   - Manages pagination state and data fetching

2. **`useMarkAsRead`, `useMarkAllAsRead`, `useDeleteNotification`**
   - Mutation hooks for notification actions with optimistic updates
   - Intelligent cache invalidation to ensure UI consistency
   - Error handling and loading state management

### State Management

- TanStack Query for server state management with caching
- Local React state for UI-specific state
- Optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- Persistent notification settings with server synchronization

## Backend Implementation

### Database Schema (Prisma)

- `Notification` model with appropriate fields and relations
- `NotificationSettings` model for user preferences
- User model extension with notification-related fields
- Enums for notification types and priorities

### API Endpoints

1. **GET `/notifications`**
   - Returns paginated notifications with optional filtering
   - Includes related alarm data for context
   - Efficient query construction to avoid over-fetching

2. **PATCH `/notifications/:id/read`**
   - Marks a single notification as read
   - Updates the readAt timestamp

3. **PATCH `/notifications/mark-all-read`**
   - Batch operation to mark all notifications as read
   - Optimized for performance with bulk update

4. **DELETE `/notifications/:id`**
   - Removes a notification from the database
   - Role-based access control for data security

5. **PUT `/notifications/settings`**
   - Updates user notification preferences
   - Creates settings if they don't exist

6. **PUT `/notifications/push-token`**
   - Updates the user's Expo push token
   - Authentication required for security

7. **POST `/notifications/send-test`**
   - Development endpoint for testing notification delivery
   - Creates a database entry and sends a push notification

### Services

1. **`NotificationService`**
   - Centralized service for notification creation and delivery
   - Handles push notification sending via Expo
   - Implements notification filtering based on user preferences
   - Manages notification muting during quiet hours

## Performance Optimizations

1. **FlashList Implementation**
   - Replaces FlatList with Shopify's FlashList for better performance
   - Uses estimated item size for optimal rendering
   - Implements recycling of off-screen components

2. **Lazy Loading / Virtualization**
   - Implements infinite scrolling with pagination
   - Only loads data when needed to reduce memory usage
   - Maintains smooth 60fps scrolling with optimized rendering

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implements stale-while-revalidate pattern with TanStack Query
   - Configures appropriate staleTime for different data types
   - Uses background refetching for fresh data without blocking UI

4. **Backend Query Optimization**
   - Selective field fetching using Prisma's select/include
   - Efficient indexing on frequently queried fields
   - Batch operations for multi-record updates

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication for all API endpoints
   - Secure token storage with Expo SecureStore

2. **Authorization**
   - Users can only access their own notifications
   - Validation of notification ownership before operations

3. **Data Sanitization**
   - Input validation for all API operations
   - Prevention of cross-site scripting in notification content

4. **Error Handling**
   - Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Client-side error recovery mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rich Notifications**
   - Support for images and action buttons in notifications
   - Interactive notifications with action responses

2. **Notification Categories**
   - More granular categorization of notifications
   - Per-category muting options

3. **Analytics**
   - Notification engagement tracking
   - Effectiveness metrics for different notification types

4. **Advanced Filtering**
   - More complex notification filtering options
   - Custom saved filters
