# Eagle Notifier - PDF Report Generation

This document outlines the implementation of the PDF report generation feature in the Eagle Notifier application.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components
- **ReportGenerator**: Modal component with format and time range selection, providing a UI for generating reports.
- **ReportsScreen**: Screen component for viewing, generating, and managing reports.
- **useReportGenerator**: Custom hook for handling report generation, opening, and sharing.

### PDF Generation
- **HTML to PDF Conversion**: Using expo-print to convert HTML templates to PDF files.
- **Data Visualization**: Included charts and tables in the generated PDFs:
  - Bar charts for alarm types and severity distribution
  - Time series data visualization for alarm activity
  - Detailed alarm table with timestamps and statuses
- **Theming**: Professionally designed PDF layout with proper styling for readability.

### File Management
- **Local Storage**: Saving generated reports to the device's document directory.
- **File Sharing**: Integration with expo-sharing for sharing reports via the native sharing dialog.
- **File Opening**: Using expo-intent-launcher (Android) and sharing API (iOS) to open files with appropriate viewers.

### Notification Integration
- **Download Notifications**: Sending a local notification when a report is generated.
- **Deep Linking**: Enabling the ability to open the report directly from the notification.

## Affected Components/Hooks
- `app/components/ReportGenerator.tsx` (existing)
- `app/utils/pdfGenerator.ts` (new)
- `app/utils/reportService.ts` (new)
- `app/hooks/useReportGenerator.ts` (new)
- `app/api/reportsApi.ts` (new)
- `app/(dashboard)/reports/index.tsx` (new)

## Styling/Navigation Changes
- Added a new "Reports" screen in the dashboard navigation.
- Used consistent styling with the rest of the application (light/dark theme support).
- Implemented responsive layouts for reports list and generator modal.
- Added appropriate status and action indicators for report generation progress.

## Performance Optimizations
- **Memoization**: Used React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary renders.
- **Async Processing**: Handled file operations asynchronously to prevent UI blocking.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly feedback.
- **Cached Data**: Used cached report data when available to minimize API calls.
- **Optimized File Size**: Generated optimized PDFs with appropriate image compression.

## Data Flow
1. User selects report parameters (format, time range) in the ReportGenerator modal.
2. The useReportGenerator hook fetches data and initiates report generation.
3. The reportService processes the data and generates an HTML template.
4. expo-print converts the HTML to a PDF file.
5. The file is saved locally and a notification is sent.
6. The report appears in the list of recent reports.
7. User can open or share the report directly from the list.

## Security Considerations
- Reports are stored in the app's secure document directory.
- Authentication token is required for API requests to fetch report data.
- No sensitive data is exposed in the report generation process.

## Next Steps
1. **Excel Report Generation**: Implement Excel report generation for data analysis.
2. **Report Templates**: Add multiple templates for different reporting needs.
3. **Scheduled Reports**: Allow users to schedule automatic report generation.
4. **Cloud Storage**: Add option to save reports to cloud storage services.
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Enhance report filtering options for more specific reports.
6. **Interactive Elements**: Add interactive elements to PDF reports (when supported by viewers).

## User Experience
- Clear, intuitive interface for report generation
- Visual feedback during report generation process
- Easy access to previously generated reports
- Multiple sharing options for collaboration
- Immediate notification when reports are ready

This feature enhances the Eagle Notifier app by providing comprehensive reporting capabilities for alarm data, helping users analyze alarm patterns and maintain compliance documentation.
